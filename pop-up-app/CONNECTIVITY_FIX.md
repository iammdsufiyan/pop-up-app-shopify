# 🔧 Shopify CLI Connectivity Fix

## 🚨 **Current Issues**
- "Failed to fetch the latest status of the development store preview"
- "The currently available CLI credentials are invalid"

## ✅ **Current Status**
- ✅ **Development server is running** (PID: 48459)
- ✅ **Popup extension is deployed** and ready
- ❌ **CLI authentication expired**

## 🛠️ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Restart Development Server (Recommended)**

1. **Stop the current server:**
   ```bash
   kill 48459
   ```
   Or find the terminal running `shopify app dev` and press `Ctrl+C`

2. **Wait 10 seconds** for ports to be released

3. **Restart with fresh authentication:**
   ```bash
   shopify app dev
   ```

4. **Follow authentication prompts** when they appear

### **Option 2: Re-authenticate CLI**

1. **Logout and restart (authentication happens automatically):**
   ```bash
   shopify auth logout
   ```

2. **Then restart your app (will prompt for authentication):**
   ```bash
   shopify app dev
   ```

### **Option 3: Clear CLI Cache**

1. **Clear Shopify CLI cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/shopify
   ```

2. **Restart development server:**
   ```bash
   shopify app dev
   ```

## 🎯 **Expected Result After Fix**

You should see output like:
```
Preview URL: https://booksss12345.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/redirect_from_cli?client_id=...
GraphiQL URL: http://localhost:XXXX/graphiql

› Press d │ toggle development store preview: ✔ on
› Press g │ open GraphiQL (Admin API) in your browser
› Press p │ preview in your browser
› Press q │ quit
```

## 🚀 **After Connectivity is Fixed**

1. **Use the Preview URL** to access your Shopify admin
2. **Go to Online Store > Themes > Customize**
3. **Enable "Discount Pop-up" in App embeds**
4. **Test your popup** on the storefront

## 💡 **Important Notes**

- **Your popup code is ready** - this is just a CLI connectivity issue
- **The extension was successfully deployed** earlier
- **Once CLI is fixed, popup will work immediately** after enabling in theme
- **No code changes needed** - just authentication refresh

## 🔍 **If Issues Persist**

1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Verify Shopify Partner account access**
3. **Ensure development store is still active**
4. **Try using a different terminal/shell**

Your popup functionality is complete - this is just a temporary CLI authentication issue that's easily resolved!
