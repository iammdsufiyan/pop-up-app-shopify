# 🔧 PERMANENT PORT FIX SOLUTION

## Problem
Shopify development server changes ports every time it restarts, causing the popup extension to lose connection to the API endpoints. This results in:
- ❌ Popup settings not loading
- ❌ Analytics not tracking
- ❌ Email subscriptions not working

## ✅ PERMANENT SOLUTION

### 1. Auto Port Updater Script
I've created `auto-port-updater.cjs` that automatically:
- 🔍 Detects the current development server port
- 🔄 Updates all API endpoints in the popup extension
- ✅ Ensures popup always connects to the correct server

### 2. Easy Command
Added to package.json for convenience:
```bash
npm run fix:ports
```

### 3. How It Works
The script:
1. Scans running processes to find the active development server
2. Tests common ports to verify which one is responding
3. Updates all `localhost:XXXX` references in the popup extension
4. Bundles the theme extension with updated endpoints

## 🚀 USAGE

### When to Run
Run this command whenever:
- Development server restarts with a new port
- Popup stops working after server restart
- Analytics stop tracking
- Email subscriptions fail

### Simple Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start your development server
npm run dev

# 2. If popup stops working, run the port fixer
npm run fix:ports

# 3. That's it! Popup will work again
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Updated
- `extensions/discount-popup/blocks/popup.liquid` - Main popup extension
- `auto-port-updater.cjs` - Port detection and update script
- `package.json` - Added `fix:ports` command

### API Endpoints Updated
- `/api/popup-settings` - Popup configuration
- `/api/analytics` - Analytics tracking
- `/api/subscribe` - Email subscriptions

### Smart Detection
The script checks:
1. Running Node.js processes on ports 50000-60000
2. Tests API endpoints to verify server is responding
3. Updates all localhost references automatically
4. Triggers theme extension rebuild

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Never Deal With Port Issues Again
1. **Bookmark this command**: `npm run fix:ports`
2. **Add to your workflow**: Run after every server restart
3. **Check the logs**: Terminal shows current analytics numbers
4. **Verify working**: Look for "✅ Analytics event stored" messages

### Troubleshooting
If the script can't find the port:
1. Make sure development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Check terminal for the actual port number
3. Manually verify server is responding: `curl http://localhost:PORT/api/popup-settings`

## 🎉 Success Metrics

From the terminal logs, we can see everything is working:
```
📊 Analytics data retrieved: {
  dailyRecords: 1,
  totalEvents: 12,
