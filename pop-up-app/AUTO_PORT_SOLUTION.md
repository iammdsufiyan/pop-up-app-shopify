# 🚀 Automatic Port Detection & Update System

## Problem Solved
Previously, every time the Shopify development server started on a different port, the popup extension would fail to connect because it was hardcoded to use old port numbers. This required manual intervention every time.

## 🎯 Permanent Solution

### New Smart Development Workflow

Instead of manually fixing ports every time, use these new automated commands:

```bash
# 🌟 RECOMMENDED: Start development with automatic port detection
npm run dev:auto
# or
npm run dev:smart

# 🔧 Manual port fix (if needed)
npm run fix:ports:smart
```

### How It Works

1. **Smart Port Detection**: The system automatically scans for your running development server
2. **Automatic Updates**: Updates the popup extension code with the correct port
3. **Zero Manual Intervention**: Works seamlessly in the background
4. **Multiple Detection Methods**: Uses several techniques to find the correct port

### Files Created

- **`smart-port-updater.js`** - Advanced port detection and updating logic
- **`dev-with-auto-port.sh`** - Enhanced development script with auto-port detection
- **`AUTO_PORT_SOLUTION.md`** - This documentation

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Option 1: Fully Automated (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:auto
```
This will:
1. Clean up any existing processes
2. Start the Shopify development server
3. Automatically detect the server port
4. Update the popup extension with the correct port
5. Confirm everything is working

### Option 2: Manual Port Fix
If you already have a server running:
```bash
npm run fix:ports:smart
```

## 🔍 How Port Detection Works

The smart port updater uses multiple detection methods:

1. **Process Scanning**: Looks for Remix/Vite/Shopify processes
2. **Network Analysis**: Scans network connections for active servers
3. **API Testing**: Tests ports to confirm they respond to our API endpoints
4. **Fallback Ports**: Tries common development server ports

## 📱 Popup Extension Updates

The system automatically updates these parts of the popup extension:

- `getCurrentDevPort()` function
- Hardcoded port variables
- API endpoint URLs
- Fallback port arrays

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **No More Manual Port Updates**: Completely automated
✅ **Works Every Time**: Multiple detection methods ensure reliability
✅ **Zero Downtime**: Updates happen without stopping the server
✅ **Smart Detection**: Finds the correct port even if it changes
✅ **Background Operation**: Works silently while you develop

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Auto-Detection Fails
1. Make sure your development server is fully started
2. Wait 10-15 seconds after server startup
3. Try the manual fix: `npm run fix:ports:smart`

### If Popup Still Doesn't Work
1. Check browser console for connection errors
2. Verify the server is running on the detected port
3. Clear browser cache and try again

## 📋 Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev:auto` | Start development with automatic port detection |
| `npm run dev:smart` | Same as dev:auto (alternative name) |
| `npm run fix:ports:smart` | Manually run smart port detection and update |
| `npm run dev:safe` | Original safe development script |
| `npm run fix:ports` | Original port fixer (less reliable) |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

The system can be enhanced with:
- Real-time port monitoring
- Automatic reconnection on port changes
- Integration with VS Code tasks
- Notification system for port updates

**🎯 Bottom Line**: Use `npm run dev:auto` and never worry about port conflicts again!
